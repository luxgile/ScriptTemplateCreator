# ScriptTemplateCreator
Creator of Unity's scripts templates

# **Usage**

Just open the ScriptTemplateCreator window in Tools/ScriptTemplateCreator.
There are two modes to create templates. Default and Raw:
- Default is more friendly and helps you to visualize better the template and possible problems it could have.
- Raw let's you write any content you want in the template if you need more freedom.

You can save the template data as ScriptableObjects in case you want to modify or save them. The package have some templates already, including:
- Empty Class
- Empty Monobehaviour
- Empty ScriptableObject
- Empty Editor Inspector
- Empty Editor Window
- Empty Property Drawer

You can use any of these templates to modify them and create your own.

Once you have everything set, just press "Create Template".

<b>Note:</b> Unity needs to restart in order to see the new templates.

<b>Note 2:</b> Don't move the .txt files from the default folder "ScriptTemplates" as they need to be there in order to work.
